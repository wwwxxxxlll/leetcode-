#### Course Project
##### 1. Multi-Person Online Collaborative Documentation Tool  
##### &emsp;February 2022 - May 2022
+ Using SpringBoot and React to implement, using Docker to isolate middlwares and backend program, finally publish as Docker image.
+ The OT algorithm is used to process the input of multiple users operating the same file at the same time, and the user's operation intention is retained through the algorithm design.
+ Collect user input and system output through RabbitMQ, and distribute data regularly using RabbitMQ and cron
##### 2. MiniSQL
##### &emsp;May 2021 - June 2021
+ Implements a DBMS with simple functions in C++ which could create/delete table, create/delete index, and CURD for records.
+ Could create primary key index on primary key automatically, could create index on unique keys (index implemented using B+ tree).  
##### 3. Distributed DataBase
##### &emsp;February 2022 - May 2022
+ Implemented a distributed database including four parts: 
+ + curator : providing access between region server and client and average equilibrium for client.
  + region server : storing data store and providing consistency access between region servers.
  + client : providing interpreter for commands and data cache.
  + log server : storing binlog in row format, mainly for disaster recovery.
